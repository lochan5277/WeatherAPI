## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WeatherApp.git
cd WeatherApp
```
### 2. Set Up MongoDB

- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or on a cloud instance.
- Create a database named `Blazors`.
- Inside the database, create the following collections:
  - `WUsers` ‚Äî for storing user login details and favorite city/weather preferences.
  - `WeatherData` ‚Äî for storing static 5-day weather data manually.

#### Sample `WeatherData` document structure:

```json
{
  "City": "London",
  "Date": "2024-07-28T00:00:00Z",
  "Temperature": 24,
  "Description": "Cloudy"
}
```

### 3. Configure appsettings.json (in Server project)

```json
{
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "your-secret-key"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MongoDb": "mongodb://localhost:27017"
  },
  "OpenWeatherMap": {
    "ApiKey": "your_openweathermap_api_key"
  }
}
```

Replace:

- "your-secret-key" with a long, random secure key.
- "your_openweathermap_api_key" with your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

### 4. Build and Run the App
